Someone did something nice for you and gave you a card telling you to come here. Your heart is brimming with warmth. Let it out.

<h3>
Pass it on! Do something nice for a stranger, and hand them the card that you got. It doesn't have to be life-changing&mdash;just a nice little favor to make someone's day a little better.
